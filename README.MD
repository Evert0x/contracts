# THX - Reward Pool

This repository holds the smart contracts used within the THX ecosystem. This document should provide more information about the configuration and governance of a reward pool. It also lists the tests for features in the contracts, explains the upgradability and references to the implemented Open Zeppelin standard contracts.

## Contract Tests

-   [x] Make a deposit
-   [x] Claim a reward
-   [x] Propose a reward
-   [x] Approve a reward proposal
-   [ ] Reject a reward proposal
-   [x] Withdraw a reward
-   [x] Create a reward rule proposal
-   [x] Approve a reward rule proposal
-   [ ] Reject a reward rule proposal
-   [x] Add a member
-   [x] Revoke member role
-   [x] Add a manager
-   [x] Revoke manager role

## Events

```
event Withdrawn(address indexed beneficiary, uint256 reward);
event Deposited(address indexed sender, uint256 amount);
event RewardRulePollCreated(uint256 id, uint256 proposal, address account);
event RewardRulePollFinished(uint256 id, uint256 proposal, bool agree);
event RewardRuleUpdated(uint256 id, RewardRuleState state, uint256 amount);
event RewardPollCreated(address reward);
event RewardPollFinished(address reward, bool agree);
```

## Configuration

-   rewardPollDuration (default set to `0`)
-   rewardRulePollDuration (default set to `0`)

## Governance

Two types of polls are extended from the BasePoll contract. The polls are used to change rewardRule sizes and approve reward proposals and claims.

### Reward Rule Poll

An account with the `MEMBER_ROLE` can cast a vote and the default `vote.weight` will be `1`. When the member revokes its vote `vote.time` will be set to `0`.

### Reward Poll

An account with the `MANAGER_ROLE` can cast a vote and the default `vote.weight` will be `1`. When the member revokes its vote `vote.time` will be set to `0`.

## Upgrades

Make sure to have a local RPC running at `http://localhost:7545` and run `yarn serve` to execute the upgrade test script as found in the index.js file. This will display logs while updating an instance of the Reward Pool contract. Make sure to duplicate the RewardPool contract and alter the `setRewardPollDuration()` method as proposed in the comments of the test script.

```
// Make a change in the RewardPool contract logic (multiply the value of
// setRewardPollDuration method by 2), change the contract name to
// RewardPoolV2 and compile it.
```

Output should be something like this:

```
Reward Pool Admin Project is created
Reward Pool Proxy is created
Reward Pool Proxy receives 5000
Set rewardPollDuration to 180
Adds member 0x5e0603a66bD209F13477C113dfd95B839026a2b2

## OpenZeppelin

This sections described the Open Zeppelin standard contracts that are used in the THX contract layer.

### [ERC20 Token](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc20)

THXToken inherits all logic from this standard contract and adds some logic for integration with the Transfer Gateway. THXTokenRinkeby is the ERC20 contract that is actually deployed on Ethereum networks (Rinkeby as of today).

### [Ownable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/access-control)

RewardPool is derived from the Ownable smart contract and inherits ownership features. Usefull when transfering ownership of a pool and restricting breaking mutations to the smart contracts. Also a necessity for the upgradability of the contract. [Read more about upgradability](#Upgrades).

### [Access Control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/access-control)

AccessControl is used to create MEMBER_ROLE and MANAGER_ROLE. MEMBER_ROLE is used to identify members of a reward pool and allow them to claim rewards and vote on reward rule proposals.
